# Overview of the Project

### Project: Creating a Students Grade Tracker

![Screenshot 2024-12-09 162504](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf4ac11a-62bf-4c41-bcf7-06d14e054ae6)



### Objective
-Grade Management: Enable users to input and manage grades for different subjects.
-Average Calculation: Calculate the average grade across all subjects.
-GPA Calculation: Convert the average grade into a GPA on a standard scale.
-Letter Grade Assignment: Provide a letter grade based on the average score.
-User-Friendly Interface: Offer a simple command-line interface for ease of use.
-Data Validation: Ensure that only valid numeric inputs are accepted.

### Key Activities

-Add Grade: Users can input grades for specific subjects.
            The system allows multiple grades per subject.
-Calculate Average Grade: Computes the average of all grades entered by the user.
-Calculate GPA: Converts the average grade into a GPA based on a 0-100 scale.
-Get Letter Grade: Determines the letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average grade.
-Display Grades: Shows all recorded grades for each subject in a readable format.
-Interactive Menu: Provides an easy-to-navigate menu for users to choose actions.

### Technologies used
-Class Definition: The StudentGrades class manages grades with methods to add grades, calculate averages, compute GPA, get letter grades, and display results.
-User Input Handling: Prompts users for input and validates that grades are numeric and within an acceptable range (0-100).
-Menu Navigation: Displays options for adding grades, calculating averages, displaying grades, or exiting the program.
-Error Handling: Includes error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric values).
-Looping Mechanism: Uses a loop to allow continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit.

### Code Structure
-add_grade(subject, grade): Adds a new grade to the specified subject.
-calculate_average(): Computes the average of all entered grades.
-calculate_gpa(): Converts the average grade into GPA (scale of 0-4).
-get_letter_grade(average): Returns the letter grade based on the average score.
-display_grades(): Prints all recorded grades by subject.

### Key Insights
-User Experience: The system is designed with user experience in mind, providing clear prompts and feedback throughout interactions.
-Data Validation: Ensures that only valid inputs are accepted, which enhances reliability and prevents errors during calculations.
-Educational Value: This project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for beginners in programming by demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts and data management techniques.
-Extensibility: The modular design allows for easy enhancement of features such as saving data to a file or database for persistent storage.

### Conclusion
The Student Grades Management System is a practical tool that helps users manage academic performance effectively while providing valuable programming experience in Python development. This project can be further enhanced with additional features such as graphical user interfaces or integration with databases for more complex data management needs.
